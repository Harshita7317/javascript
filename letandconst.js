//variables are containers which are used to store data .
//variables are initalized with two types of declarations:
//1. let => let is used when data needs to be updated in future.
//2. const => when data has to be kept constant.
//use of let(when data will be updated)
//let a=15;
//a=20;
//console.log(a);
//use of const(when data has to be kept constant)
//const a=10;
//console.log(a);

//in other languages declarations depend on datatypes
//int a=10; 
//string c ="Harshita";
//boolean a=true;

//in js we can use let or const for each kind of data
//let a=10; //number
let a="Harshita";
let c=true;
let d=[1,2,3,4];
let e={a: "harshita"};
console.log(a);
console.log(d);
console.log(c);

const f=10;
const g="harshita";
const h=[1,2,3,4];
console.log(f);
console.log(g);
console.log(h);
